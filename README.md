# 🌊 Water Pollution Monitor using Arduino

A simple and cost-effective system to monitor water quality using Arduino and basic sensors. This project focuses on measuring **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** and **turbidity**, providing real-time insights into water pollution levels. It is suitable for applications in agriculture, fish farming, and environmental monitoring.

## 📌 Introduction

Water quality is critical for human health, aquatic life, and agriculture. This project enables continuous monitoring of water bodies using:
- **TDS Sensor**: Measures the amount of dissolved solids in water (e.g., salts, minerals).
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Measures the clarity of water by detecting suspended particles.
